# BUParking
The Boston University Parking Lots Management Application will improve the drivers’ parking experience at BU parking lots. For BU students, employees, and guests, the app reduces parking lot searching time and simplifies the parking permit application while BU has the limited availability of the parking space, and the time-consuming permit application process. 

## Project Objective
We are going to deliver a solution that provides the following features:

1.	Secured user account 
2.	Permit reservation with vehicle information by non-first-year BU students, BU faculty and staff, and guests
3.	Able to update existing vehicle information under an existing permit
4.	Display locations of all BU-owned lots and garages on a map
5.	Display pricing, availability, policies, and other information for each permit
6.	Display available lots based on the type of permit held by the user including availability on different days and times
7.	Secured credit card payment
8.	Display availability estimated for each lot/garage depending on the survey after user’s parking 

## Stakeholders
a.	Boston University Parking and Transportation Services:
-	Interests: high interest. The project lets the department collect all the information in one database for better management. It also can maximize the parking space utilization for better economic benefit.
-	Impact: biggest impact on the project since the department will provide the most essential information: location of the parking lots, the capacity of each parking lot, parking rates, information about all the permits, etc)
-	Potential influences: BU would benefit from the project and so do the overall industry of the parking lot management system. As one of the major academic institutions with an overall population of 44,000, BU is approximately a medium-sized city in the state. The successful parking management at BU exemplifies a potential prototype for other academic institutions(similar population) in the limited parking space. 
b.	Non-first-year BU student drivers: 
-	Interests: high interest. Students can apply for new permits, check the parking availability, and rates, display their permits, and make payments on one platform. The app will provide more transparent information that lets students find the desired lot. 
-	Impact: students can provide their essential needs on on-campus parking and give feedback on our project. 
-	Potential influences: Students are the largest demographic requiring parking on the BU campus. Congestion around BU streets can be significantly reduced by reducing the amount of time each student spends searching for a parking spot. Significant reduction in time consumption may also make the process of traveling between classes smoother, allowing students to arrive at classes on time, and reducing disruption to lectures. 
c.	BU faculty and staff drivers:
-	Interests: high interest. Faculty and staff can apply for new permits, check the parking availability, and rates, display their permits and make payments on one platform. The app will provide more transparent information that lets employees find the desired lot.
-	Impact: employees can provide their essential needs on on-campus parking and give feedback on our project. 
-	Potential influences: Faculty and staff drivers park on campus almost every day, occupying parking spaces regularly. Congestion around BU streets can be significantly reduced by reducing the amount of time each faculty or staff member spends on parking spot searching. Significant reductions in time consumption may also allow faculty and staff to arrive at classes/shifts on time, reducing disruption to students’ education, and smoothening the shift turnover process. 
d.	Guest drivers 
-	Interests: BU guests can apply for new permits, check the parking availability, and rates, display their permits, and make payments on one platform. The app will provide more transparent information that lets employees find the desired lot.
-	Impact: employees can provide their essential needs on on-campus parking and give feedback on our project
-	Potential influences: BU guests can apply and reserve the guest pass efficiently. They will not waste time looking for parking and be late for the event. Great parking experience will leave guests, especially potential students and their parents, with a good impression of BU


## Acceptance criteria
-	Boston University Parking and Transportation Services: 
The app will have a clear categorization of different information(permits, vehicle information, accounts) and saved in a secured database for easy management 
-	Non-first-year BU students: 
The app will show collective and transparent information about all the available parking spaces within BU campus. Students are able to apply for a new permit, update vehicle information and make payments on the app.
-	BU faculty and staff: 
The app will show collective and transparent information about all the available parking spaces within the BU campus, and they are able to apply for a new permit, update vehicle information and make payments on the app.
-	Guest drivers: 
The app will show collective and transparent information about all the available parking spaces on the BU campus. They are able to apply for a new permit, update vehicle information and make payments on the app.

## Use Case Diagram

**Diagram.1**
In the use case diagram there are three major actors and four major use cases. The actors are BU Employee and Staff, Guest, and Non-First-Year BU Student while the guests and students can be categorized into two more specific types of users. All the actors benefit from the four system functionalities: Privacy, Reserve New Permit, Update Vehicle Information and Find Desired Lot. For the use case order a new permit and update vehicle information, each has an included use case.
